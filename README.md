Building a Virtualized List Component with React Window for 100,000 Items
Rendering large lists in React can quickly become a performance bottleneck. If you try to render 100,000 items directly, your app will slow down, the browser might freeze, and users will have a poor experience. To solve this, we can use React Window, a lightweight and efficient library from Brian Vaughn (creator of React Virtualized), to create a virtualized list that only renders visible items in the viewport.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a virtualized list component using React Window that can smoothly render 100,000 items.
